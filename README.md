# Ring Signatures

Implementations of Ring Signature schemes.
See [How to Leak a Secret](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/RST01.pdf) for the original paper.

The paper describes ring signatures using RSA, but this repository implements ring signatures using elliptic curves instead, based on Schnorr signatures.
